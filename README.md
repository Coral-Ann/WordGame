Project Requirements
-------
This program should allow users to do the following:

- When the game starts, it will choose a random word from a list of words.
- The game will then display the word to guess, with only the first letter visible (e.g H____ for "HOUSE").
- The player starts a counter of 10 attempts.
- The player will then be prompted to enter a letter they think might be in the word.
- If the letter is in the word, the game will display the word to guess, with the new letter visible.
- If the letter is not in the word, the game will display the same letters as before, and decrease the counter of remaining attempts.
- If the counter of attempts reaches zero, the player loses.
- If the player finds all the letters in the word, they win.
